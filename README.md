ring
====
First run ```make```.
Usage: for repl type ```./ring```. Otherwise the structure goes like this: 

```./ring [-i infile | [infile -o outfile]]```

The ```-i``` instructs the interpreter to run interactively after executing the contents of ```infile``` (though this isn't working at the moment).
